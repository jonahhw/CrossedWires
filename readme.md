## Crossed Wires
Crossed Wires is a fighting game where you play as a mech with a wiring issue. Every few seconds, the actions you have available are randomized.

This was made for the GMTK game jam 2022, so it's in a pretty rough state at the moment. Things I still need to do to improve the project to a reasonable level are:
- Add an AI enemy for 1 player mode
- Make title and game-over screens that actually look nice
- Refactor the code to make it more readable and re-usable
- Fix a few weirdnesses, like the blasts and bolts being child scenes of the mech that fired them
- Possible eventual things:
	- more stages
	- more music
	- improve animation
	- more mechanics
	- potentially more characters if I can think of a way for that to make sense

I may or may not do any of those things; we'll see.

Note that, though even now the source code isn't exactly the same as it was when I submitted to the jam, **No builds will be uploaded** until the jam is complete. If you want to rate the game, please do so before downloading any source code or looking at any modifications.
